If using Windows, run everything in WSL.

Before starting, setup dev env with:
```bash
bash ./gen.sh
```

This will generate the necessary schema.proto javascript files the serviecs will need
Currently, if you make a change to the root schema.proto, you will need to re-run that above command to regenerate types & javascript.

## Running services (api, redis, postgres, pgadmin):
Use `docker compose up` to start services

## Running frontend
```
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

Should be that simple! :)

## Generating documentation
API documentation is only available in dev, not for production. It can be automatically generated by running:
```bash
cd api
yarn install
yarn run docs
```

The output generated into `api/public/documentation.html`, and is gitignored so it doesn't end up in production

To access the documentation, simply start the services (`docker compose up`) and go to `http://localhost:3000/docs`
